### Created with joy by pawel-peksa

Hey! This is my first project (from idea to deployment) in JavaScript & React.
It has three main goals:

- make peoples (and mine) live easier to keep track of their investments
- show my skills in JavaScript and React
- and last but not least - have some fun during coding!

I would love to get some feedback from you!
