### Created by pawel-peksa

This is my first project (from idea to deployment) in JavaScript & React.
It has three main goals:

- to help people keep track of all of their investments 
- to show my skills in JavaScript and React
- and last but not least - to have some fun during coding ;)

Tools, technologies and bigger libraries:
- React
- Material UI
- Firebase Authentication
- Firestore
- React Router v6
- Recharts
- React hook form

To take care of fetching data I used:
- coingeko for cryptocurrencies
- yahoo-finance2 for stock info => Here I had to modify it a little by implementing proxy-server set up on heroku to take care of CORS.
  Modification of the package will work on every copy thanks to patch-package. If somehow the patch won't be installed out of the box, run npm i patch-package.
  

I would love to get some feedback from you!
