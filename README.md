### Created by pawel-peksa

This is my first project (from idea to deployment) in JavaScript & React.
It has three main goals:

- make people (and mine) live easier to keep track of their investments
- show my skills in JavaScript and React
- and last but not least - have some fun during coding ;)

Tools, technologies and bigger libraries:
- Firebase Authentication 
- Firestore
- React Router v6
- Recharts
- React hook form

To take care of fetching data I used:
- coingeko for cryptocurrencies
- yahoo-finance2 for stock info => Here I had to modify it a little by implementing proxy-server set up on heroku to take care of CORS.
  Modification of the package will work on every copy thanks to patch-package. If somehow patch will not be installed out of the box run npm i patch-package.
  

I would love to get some feedback from you!
